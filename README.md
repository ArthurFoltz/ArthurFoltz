### Arthur Foltz's profile ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer currently working at Dell Technologies and finishing my 8th and last semester of Software Engineering at PUCRS, passionate about technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. I have experience developing automation tools and backend APIs using Java and Python, collaborating with international teams in Agile/Scrum environments. I enjoy working with people from different cultures, and Iâ€™m now seeking new opportunities to further develop my technical skills and contribute to challenging projects while collaborating with diverse teams. Outside of work, I love cats, going to the gym, watching series, traveling, and Iâ€™m a big fan of winter.
